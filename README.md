This is the one of the latest programs I created. It is based on a whole bunch of new technologies that I have recently mastered. However, the main essence of the app has not changed: maintaining a public (or private) bookmarks catalog, in which the author not only adds the title, genres and episodes of watched TV shows and films, books and music, but also adds his/here own rating to it. In addition to completely rewriting code off the app, using the new programming language, the program received a completely new, compact, adaptive and partially customizable interface, several new functions, such as searching through collections, caching your bookmarks images in the app's memory, adding (optional) small comments  to the individual entitities.
